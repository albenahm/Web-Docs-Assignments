- **:birthday: Our cakes and facts :**

The earliest versions of cake were actually flat, compact discs of grain which were dried and compacted together. The closest resemblance to the cakes we enjoy today actually didn’t appear until the early 18th century, as before this time, they were raised with yeast and closer to bread than cakes.

- *:waffle: Our biscuits :*

**Biscuit facts :**

1. As studies show a rise in elevenses and tea-time occasions as a result of being in lockdown with friends and family, 40 per cent of Brits have said they’ve been enjoying more biscuits during this time.

2. British biscuit consumption is the highest in the world, higher than all major European countries and even 35 per cent higher than the US.

3. Biscuits are bought by 27 million households and eaten on 6 billion occasions a year.

4. 61 per cent of the UK have a biscuit tin, with the city of Norwich the biggest fans of biscuit tins.

5. Biscuits were the first food to reach the South Pole with the explorer Roald Amundsen in 1911.

6. If you laid all the Jaffa Cakes eaten each year in a line, they would stretch from the UK to Australia and back.

**How biscuits are to be made :**
1. The butter and milk for this recipe need to be as cold as possible for fluffy and soft biscuits. I freeze my butter before using it and recommend keeping the milk in the refrigerator right up until it’s time to add it to the dry ingredients.

2. Don’t overwork the dough! Keep in mind that you want your butter to stay as cold as possible when making these biscuits, and the more you have your hands on the dough the softer the butter will become. Definitely don’t use an electric mixer for this recipe.

3. We’re going to do a little bit of laminating. This means folding the dough over itself multiple times (5-6 times here) to encourage flaky layers in our biscuits. 

4. You can watch the video below to see exactly how this is done.

5. Don’t use a rolling pin, use your hands to gently work the dough into a flat rectangle before cutting out your biscuits.

6. Don’t be afraid to add flour to the dough if it’s too sticky while you are handling it (and make sure to work on a lightly floured surface).

- *:chocolate_bar: Our chocolates:*

**Facts :**
1. Chocolates Can Help Prevent Tooth Decay

2. It is said that chocolates have more than 500 flavours available

3. Cacao Beans Were Used As A Currency, Once In History

4. Hot Chocolate Was The First Chocolate Treat

5. Chocolate Milk Could Be A Post-Workout Recovery Drink

6. Milk Chocolate Was Invented In Switzerland

**How we make chocolate :**
1. Cocoa mass can simply be combined with more cocoa butter and sweetener to make chocolate. The first steps are to mix, grind, and knead the various raw ingredients into a paste.
2. “Conching” is a careful process of rolling, kneading, heating, and aeration. A conche is a large agitator that stirs and smooths the mixture under heat.
This is an important step in the process of producing consistent, pure, and delicious gourmet chocolate — and it is here that the final aroma and flavor are defined.
At this point, soy lecithin and cocoa butter may be added for required fluidity. Chocolate is then refined until smooth (and the longer a chocolate is conched, the smoother it will be).
3. The chocolate is now finished and ready for final processing. To be delivered to a chocolatier, it must first be put into blocks or drops (also called “pistoles”).
4. This method requires “tempering” — whereby chocolate is slowly brought to a certain temperature. Tempering chocolate is something any aspiring baker or chocolate maker can try at home.
5. During the tempering process, the cocoa butter reaches its most stable form; this gives well-tempered chocolate its “snap,” shiny surface, and smoothness.White chocolate is made with cocoa butter, sugar, and milk powder (but no cocoa mass/liquor). Because it contains no cocoa mass, some do not consider it a true chocolate.

- *:carrot: Our vegan food :*

**Facts :**
1. Vegan food is delicious and very diverse
2. A plant-based diet can easily provide complete protein!
3. The easiest way to try veganism is with Challenge 22
The ingredients used are dependent on the type of chocolate being made. Dark chocolate requires only cocoa mass, cocoa butter, and sugar. Adding milk powder makes milk chocolate.

**How we make :**

1. What, to you, is the perfect simple salad? I’m not talking lunch salads or grain salads, but the simplest of dinner accompaniments, the salad that gets tossed at the last moment to lay beside a piece of grilled chicken or a plate of pasta. This kind of salad often feels like an afterthought. It’s the obligatory vegetable to be munched down before enjoying the rest of your dinner. But this doesn’t need to be so! Here are some thoughts, tips, and directions to help you turn your side salad into the most delicious part of the meal.

2. This is of course not a hard and fast instructional. Everyone has different tastes in salad and I bow to that. Maybe you like yours with a creamy dressing; maybe you like yours super assertive like Amanda Hesser and her anchovy-spiked vinaigrette. Maybe you like to always have extra vegetables in your salad or, like me, you just want to keep it ultra-simple.

3. The point, no matter how you decide to dress your salad — up or down — is that it taste delicious. Salads need seasoning too, just like any other dish.

So here are my thoughts and process on making a quick salad for dinner. I do this nearly every time I make dinner, and often I unexpectedly enjoy this pile of greens more than anything else on the table. There’s a purity and deliciousness to a well-dressed pile of greens that other, more complex, dishes often do not approach.
